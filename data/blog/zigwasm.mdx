summary: How to send numbers, strings, and arbitrary objects to Zig WASM
---

I just started on my Zig + WASM journey, and I had to go through a few incomplete or outdated resources before I figured it out to my satisfaction.
So this is my attempt to compile it all into one place, it should work until anything in the world changes again ðŸ™‚.

We will go through the basic setup with passing numbers to and from WASM, then I'll show the more complicated case of strings and finally objects (using JSON).

## Adding numbers

Let's start with the "Hello, world" of WASMâ€”the `add` function.
If we can add two numbers from WASM, we know that we set things up correctly.
The same example is found in the [Zig Language Reference](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#WebAssembly).

Create this file:

```zig:add.zig
extern fn print(i32) void;

export fn add(a: i32, b: i32) void {
    print(a + b);
}
```

The compilation depends on the version of zig, for the latest release (v0.11) we have:

```bash:zig11.sh
zig build-lib add.zig -target wasm32-freestanding -dynamic --export=add -O ReleaseFast
```

In v0.12 this changes to

```bash:zig12.sh
zig build-exe add.zig -target wasm32-freestanding -fno-entry --export=add -O ReleaseFast
```

This produces a file `add.wasm` in binary format. To get a feel for how it works, I recommend looking at the human-readable **W**eb**A**ssembly **t**ext format with `wasm2wat add.wasm`.

```wasm
(module
  (type (;0;) (func (param i32)))
  (type (;1;) (func (param i32 i32)))
  (import "env" "print" (func $print (type 0)))
  (func $add (type 1) (param i32 i32)
    local.get 1
    local.get 0
    i32.add
    call $print)
  (memory (;0;) 16)
  (global $__stack_pointer (mut i32) (i32.const 1048576))
  (export "memory" (memory 0))
  (export "add" (func $add)))
```

We import a function `print` from module `env`, then declare and export a function `add` that uses it.
We also declare and export memory with initial 16 pages, in WebAssembly each page is 64KiB for a total of 1 MiB.
As this is "heap" memory, we don't use it in this program.
You can learn more about the WAT format on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format).

To run it, we need an environment capable of using the exported function.
Here is how you can do it in Node.js:

```javascript:noderun.js
const fs = require('fs');
const source = fs.readFileSync('./add.wasm');

WebAssembly.instantiate(source, { env: { print: (x) => console.log(x) } })
.then((result) => {
  const add = result.instance.exports.add;
  add(1, 2);
});

```

We pass a wrapped `console.log` for the imported `env.print`, and use the exported `add` function.
Running with `node noderun.js`, we'll see `3` on the console output.

It's a bit more convenient with Bun (written in Zig btw):

```typescript:bunrun.ts
const source = await Bun.file('add.wasm').arrayBuffer();
const result = await WebAssembly.instantiate(source, { env: { print: (x) => console.log(x) } });
const add = result.instance.exports.add;
add(1, 2);

```

Running WASM from a server-side runtime is probably more niche since we might as well use a native binary.
Here is an example HTML file to run in the browser:

```html:index.html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>WebAssembly test</title>
  </head>
  <script type="module">
    const result = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch('add.wasm'), {
      env: { print: (x) => console.log(x) },
    });
    const add = result.instance.exports.add;
    add(1, 2);
  </script>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Because we currently can't put WASM in a `<script>` tag, we need to load it with `fetch`.
We pass the promise directly to [`instantiateStreaming`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/instantiateStreaming_static).
For testing, the `fetch` won't work when directly opening the HTML file with a browser.
We need an HTTP server, we can use the one provided with Python by running `python3 -m http.server 8080`.
Opening `http://localhost:8080`, you should see `3` in the browser console.

## Strings

When calling a WASM exported function, we can only pass numbers, and we'll receive a single number.
This is not enough for most cases, so how do we use more complex data types such as strings?
If you remember the memory from the previous section,
turns out we simply write our input into it,
call WASM which modifies the memory, and then read it back from JavaScript.

Here is an example WASM-compatible string processing function:

```zig:strings.zig
const std = @import("std");

export fn doubleString(s: [*]u8, length: usize, capacity: usize) i32 {
    if (capacity < length * 2) {
        return -1;
    }
    const left = s[0..length];
    const right = s[length .. length * 2];
    std.mem.copy(u8, right, left);
    return @as(i32, @intCast(length)) * 2;
}
```

We take a many-item pointer to `u8` which is the start of our string,
its length and the capacity (how many bytes the caller thinks we can safely write after `s`).
The WASM memory is an array of bytes, so `s` is under the hood just an index to this array.

We return the length of the result, as `i32` to use `-1` as an error code when there isn't enough capacity.
The result is written straight into the same memory we were given.

To use this, we need to access the memory array:

```javascript:noderun.js
const fs = require('fs');
const source = fs.readFileSync('./strings.wasm');

WebAssembly.instantiate(source).then((result) => {
  const { doubleString, memory } = result.instance.exports;
  const input = 'Hello ðŸ™‹ World!';

  const memoryView = new Uint8Array(memory.buffer);
  const { written } = new TextEncoder().encodeInto(input, memoryView);

  console.log(`written: ${written}, input.length: ${input.length}`);

  const outputLength = doubleString(0, written, memoryView.byteLength);
  // the output is in memory.buffer[0..outputLength]
  const outputView = new Uint8Array(memory.buffer, 0, outputLength);
  const output = new TextDecoder().decode(outputView);

  console.log(output);
});
```

As you saw in the WAT, the memory is exported as `memory`.
This is a special [`WebAssembly.Memory`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/Memory) object,
and the actual `ArrayBuffer` is accessible as `memory.buffer`.
This is important because we can [grow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/Memory/grow) our memory to make the array larger,
but this makes the old buffer detached (unusable).
If we access it as `memory.buffer`, we're safe.

We obtain a view of the buffer as a `Uint8Array` to which we can encode our string.
This also converts from the JavaScript-native UTF-16 to UTF-8.
We grab the number of bytes written from the [`encodeInto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder/encodeInto) output,
it's not equal to `input.length` because of the encoding difference.

We call our WASM function with `0` for the pointer, as we wrote the string to the memory with no offset.
Then we can decode the result back using the returned length.

Here are the results of running our program:

```
$ zig build-lib strings.zig -target wasm32-freestanding -dynamic --export=doubleString -O ReleaseFast && node noderun.js
written: 17, input.length: 15
Hello ðŸ™‹ World!Hello ðŸ™‹ World!
```

## JSON

With the ability to pass strings, we're now just one step away from passing arbitrary objects.
Zig's built-in JSON support makes this rather convenient.

```zig:json.zig
const std = @import("std");

const walloc = std.heap.wasm_allocator;

const Person = struct {
    id: i32,
    name: []u8,
};

export fn reverseNames(s: [*]u8, length: usize, capacity: usize) i32 {
    const input = s[0..length];
    const parsed = std.json.parseFromSlice([]Person, walloc, input, .{}) catch return -1;
    defer parsed.deinit();
    const people = parsed.value;

    for (people) |x| {
        std.mem.reverse(u8, x.name);
    }

    var output = std.ArrayList(u8).init(walloc);
    defer output.deinit();
    std.json.stringify(people, .{}, output.writer()) catch return -2;

    const outputLength = output.items.len;
    if (outputLength > capacity) {
        return -3;
    }
    std.mem.copy(u8, s[0..outputLength], output.items);
    return @as(i32, @intCast(outputLength));
}
```

We use the [`std.heap.WasmAllocator`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#A;std:heap.WasmAllocator) to get some memory for our object.
Then after processing, we stringify our result into a `std.ArrayList` to then copy it into the memory.
It would be nice to write it straight into `s[0..capacity]`, but I didn't find a nice way to do that.

Our JavaScript looks almost the same as before, except for handling the JSON:

```javascript:noderun.js
const fs = require('fs');
const source = fs.readFileSync('./json.wasm');

WebAssembly.instantiate(source).then((result) => {
  const { reverseNames, memory } = result.instance.exports;

  function reverseNamesNice(data) {
    const input = JSON.stringify(data);

    const memoryView = new Uint8Array(memory.buffer);
    const { written } = new TextEncoder().encodeInto(input, memoryView);

    const outputLength = reverseNames(0, written, memoryView.byteLength);

    const outputView = new Uint8Array(memory.buffer, 0, outputLength);
    const output = new TextDecoder().decode(outputView);
    return JSON.parse(output);
  }

  console.log(
    reverseNamesNice([
      { name: 'John', id: 1 },
      { name: 'Jane', id: 2 },
    ])
  );
});
```

Here are the results:

```
$ zig build-lib json.zig -target wasm32-freestanding -dynamic --export=reverseNames -O ReleaseFast && node noderun.js
[ { id: 1, name: 'nhoJ' }, { id: 2, name: 'enaJ' } ]
```

## Memory

Ok, so we can write our input/output straight into memory, but isn't this the same memory that the standard library is using?
Is this safe?
As it turns out, it's not.

We can inspect the memory as follows:

```javascript
function inspectMemory() {
  const pageSize = 2 ** 16;

  console.log('pages:', memory.buffer.byteLength / pageSize);
  const memoryView = new Uint8Array(memory.buffer);
  const used = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < memoryView.length; i++) {
    if (memoryView[i]) {
      const start = i;

      while (true) {
        const maxLookForwardBytes = 300;
        const bytesLeft = memoryView.length - i;
        const lookForwardBytes = Math.min(maxLookForwardBytes, bytesLeft);
        const forwardView = new Uint8Array(memory.buffer, i, lookForwardBytes);
        if (forwardView.every((byte) => byte === 0)) break;

        i++;
      }

      used.push([start, i - start]);
    }
  }
  console.log(
    used.map(
      ([start, length]) =>
        `page:${Math.floor(start / pageSize)} offset:${start % pageSize} bytes:${length}`
    ),
    '\n'
  );
}

inspectMemory();
reverseNamesNice([{ name: 'Jane', id: 2 }]);
inspectMemory();
```

It's kind of a lotâ€”basically, we want to get the non-zero bytes, but it turns out there's a lot of them and not in perfectly contiguous blocks.
That's why we print the blocks of non-zero bytes smoothed out a bit when there's less than 300 zeroes of gap.
We also print their locations as page+offset, which turns out to be pretty useful:

```
$ zig build-lib json.zig -target wasm32-freestanding -dynamic --export=reverseNames -O ReleaseFast && node noderun.js
pages: 17
[ 'page:16 offset:0 bytes:9641' ]

pages: 21
[
  'page:0 offset:0 bytes:24',
  'page:15 offset:64650 bytes:10605',
  'page:17 offset:6 bytes:43',
  'page:18 offset:0 bytes:8',
  'page:19 offset:4 bytes:104',
  'page:20 offset:0 bytes:24'
]
```

Before the `reverseNamesNice` call we have just some stuff from the standard library written on page 16,
and after we have our result at the beginning and more pages with some non-zero bytes.

We can see the initial content in the WAT:

```wasm
(data (;0;) (i32.const 1048576) "\01\00\00 (many bytes...)")
```

The number `1048576` is exactly `2**16 * 16`, which is the beginning of page 16.
I'm not sure why this seems to move to page 15 after the call.

We can use `inspectMemory` to check that freeing is working properly:

```javascript
reverseNamesNice([{ name: 'Jane', id: 2 }]);
inspectMemory();
reverseNamesNice([{ name: 'Jane', id: 2 }]);
inspectMemory();
```

output:

```
pages: 21
[
  'page:0 offset:0 bytes:24',
  'page:15 offset:64650 bytes:10605',
  'page:17 offset:6 bytes:43',
  'page:18 offset:0 bytes:8',
  'page:19 offset:4 bytes:104',
  'page:20 offset:0 bytes:24'
]

pages: 21
[
  'page:0 offset:0 bytes:24',
  'page:15 offset:64650 bytes:10605',
  'page:17 offset:6 bytes:43',
  'page:18 offset:0 bytes:8',
  'page:19 offset:4 bytes:104',
  'page:20 offset:0 bytes:24'
]
```

If we remove either of the `.deinit()` calls, we'll see more memory getting used up:

```
pages: 21
[
  'page:0 offset:0 bytes:24',
  'page:15 offset:64650 bytes:10605',
  'page:17 offset:6 bytes:43',
  'page:18 offset:0 bytes:8',
  'page:19 offset:4 bytes:104',
  'page:20 offset:0 bytes:24'
]
pages: 21
[
  'page:0 offset:0 bytes:24',
  'page:15 offset:64650 bytes:10605',
  'page:17 offset:6 bytes:75',
  'page:18 offset:0 bytes:8',
  'page:19 offset:4 bytes:360',
  'page:20 offset:0 bytes:88'
]
```

Ok, but what if we need more space than the 64650 bytes before the standard library data?
We can increase our initial memory with `--initial-memory=...`.
Unfortunately, we are forced to write it in bytes (non-multiples of the page size 64KiB won't work),
so I prefer to use a little [bash math](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Arithmetic-Expansion).

```
$ zig build-lib json.zig -target wasm32-freestanding -dynamic --export=reverseNames -O ReleaseFast --initial-memory=$((2**16 * 35)) && node noderun.js
pages: 35
[ 'page:16 offset:0 bytes:9641' ]

pages: 39
[
  'page:0 offset:0 bytes:24',
  'page:15 offset:64650 bytes:10605',
  'page:35 offset:6 bytes:43',
  'page:36 offset:0 bytes:8',
  'page:37 offset:4 bytes:104',
  'page:38 offset:0 bytes:24'
]
```

Pages 15 and 16 are still occupied, but 17-34 are now free to use.

We can also declare how much growth we need with `--max-memory=...`, there is a limit and if we don't set it, the environment will.

If we'd like to decide this from JavaScript instead, we can use `--import-memory`.
This produces `(import "env" "memory" (memory (;0;) 17))` in the WAT, the `17` is how many pages it needs at minimum.
We can use it like this:

```javascript
const memory = new WebAssembly.Memory({ initial: 35, maximum: 100 });

WebAssembly.instantiate(source, { env: { memory } }).then((result) => {
  /* here we can use memory just as before, without getting it from exports */
});
```

If we wanted to be super proper and organized, we'd probably export alloc and dealloc functions from Zig and use that to get our input/output space.

## Workers

We can run our WASM from a web worker the same way as from the main script.
There is a bit of a trap, if we do this:

```javascript
// worker.js
const result = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch('foo.wasm'));

/* no difference with `onmesssage =` */
addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  /*...*/
});

// index.html
const worker = new Worker('worker.js', { type: 'module' });
worker.postMessage('foo');
```

it will not work, I'm not sure precisely but it makes sense that the `addEventListener` call is too "slow" for the message.
Instead, we can `await` in the callback:

```javascript:worker.js
const promise = WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch('foo.wasm'));

addEventListener('message', async (event) => {
  const result = await promise;
  // ...
});
```

If you want a new instance every time (e.g. you rarely call the WASM and don't want to bother freeing the memory),
you can separate the compilation step:

```javascript:worker.js
const promise = WebAssembly.compileStreaming(fetch('foo.wasm'));

addEventListener('message', async (event) => {
  const instance = await WebAssembly.instantiate(await promise);
  // ...
});
```

Note that this is an overload of `instantiate` (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/instantiate_static)),
and `instance` is already what we previously got from `result.instance`.

You can see the code for each section on [GitHub](https://github.com/MichalGrzymek/myblog/tree/main/public/zigwasm).
